<h1> Admin-Dashboard </h1>
<ul type=bullet>
<li> This is gonna be Responsive Admin Dashboard for an Ecommerce Website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I am using modern semantic HTML, CSS and JS to create a completely responsive admin dashboard with light/dark mode theme functionality.</li>
<br>
<li> We'll be using CSS Variables, CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Media queries for our responsive design, and CSS  transitions and animations for some cool animation effects.</li>
